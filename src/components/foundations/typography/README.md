# Typography

Typography primitives provided by grundgesetz-skeleton.

## Usage

### `Heading` component

The heading component is used for all headings.

```jsx
import { ThemeReset, Heading } from 'path/to/components/foundations';

export default function MyApp({ children }) {
  return (
    <ThemeReset>
      <Heading size={900}>We are making AI technology accessible to everyone</Heading>
      <Heading size={800}>We are making AI technology accessible to everyone</Heading>
      <Heading size={700}>We are making AI technology accessible to everyone</Heading>
      <Heading size={600}>We are making AI technology accessible to everyone</Heading>
      <Heading size={500}>We are making AI technology accessible to everyone</Heading>
      <Heading size={400}>We are making AI technology accessible to everyone</Heading>
      <Heading size={300}>We are making AI technology accessible to everyone</Heading>
      <Heading size={200}>We are making AI technology accessible to everyone</Heading>
    </ThemeReset>
  );
}
```

Heading renders a `h2` by default. If you would like to determine which HTML element it renders, you can use the `as` prop.

```jsx
<ThemeReset>
  <Heading size={700} as="h3">
    We are making AI technology accessible to everyone
  </Heading>
</ThemeReset>
```

### `Text` component

The text component is used for single line text.

```jsx
import { ThemeReset, Heading } from 'path/to/components/foundations';

export default function MyApp({ children }) {
  return (
    <ThemeReset>
      <Text size={400}>We are making AI technology accessible to everyone</Text>
      <Text size={300}>We are making AI technology accessible to everyone</Text>
      <Text size={200}>We are making AI technology accessible to everyone</Text>
    </ThemeReset>
  );
}
```

Text renders a `span` by default. If you would like to determine which HTML element it renders, you can use the `as` prop.

```jsx
<ThemeReset>
  <Text size={300} as="p">
    We are making AI technology accessible to everyone
  </Heading>
</ThemeReset>
```

### `Paragraph` component

Renders a paragraph-sized text by default

```jsx
import { ThemeReset, Heading } from 'path/to/components/foundations';

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <ThemeReset>
      <Paragraph>
        We are Kata.ai, an Indonesian conversational Artificial Intelligence company, focused on understanding human
        conversation so we can improve the way humans collaborate with technology to be more productive and empowered.
        Kata.aiâ€™s Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology powers multi-purpose chatbots for major corporations in
        Indonesia across different industries, including FMCG, Telecommunication, Banking & Financial Service, and

  );
}
```
