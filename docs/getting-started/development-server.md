## Running the server

Now that we have the project set up, let's `cd` to the generated project. Here we'll have to install our node dependencies. To do so, run the following command.

```bash
# npm
npm install
# yarn
yarn
```

To start working on our documentation, we need to start a development server.

```bash
# npm
npm dev
# yarn
yarn dev
```

The command above will start a development server with hot-reloading capabilities on `localhost:8000`. From now on, you can start writing your documentation with ease. In the next section, we will learn how to build your pages and deploy them.

## Caveats

Due to limitations with Gatsby, you might have to restart the server when:

- you add a new Markdown page
- you updated the `toc.json` file
