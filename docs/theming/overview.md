Grundgesetz comes with a built-in, opinionated design which focuses on readability, but we also provide possibilities for people to extend the look of Grundgesetz by providing some foundational components for you to use.

Under the hood, Grundgesetz is styled with [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/). This allows us to provide foundational components that people can use to expand on the built-in design, and provides an easy way to update aspects of the default theme with `styled-system` APIs.

In the next few pages, you will learn how to theme Grundgesetz based on your own branding.

**Note:** [Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/) is not yet supported. To use Grundgesetz's theme, you will need to start from the skeleton. Please follow the [installation guide](/getting-started/installation) to get started.
