## Explanation

- `docs/` - Where the documentation lives. Grundgesetz will read all `.md` files and builds it in a path following the directory tree.
  - `[index.md]` - An optional Index page, if you want it to be written in Markdown. This can be replaced by a customised Index page located at `pages/index.tsx`
  - `toc.json` - The file that holds the table of contents. See [Table of Contents](/writing/table-of-contents) for more information.
- `[static/]` - Holds the static assets of the site.
- `[src/]` - The root folder for the JavaScript source.
