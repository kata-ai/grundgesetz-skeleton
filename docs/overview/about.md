Welcome to Grundgesetz. It's a skeleton for generating accessible documentation pages built on top of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org). It creates static pages from your Markdown documentation files, all prettily formatted with a easy-to-use layout.

Grundgesetz is initially built to solve internal issues in managing documentation for our products at [Kata.ai](https://kata.ai/), but at the same we also found out that it's a good base for quickly deploying a documentation site online, so we put this up for everyone to use.

## Just Your Docs

Grundgesetz is set up for you to get up and running straight away. All your docs are written in Markdown and go inside the `/docs` folder. The table of contents is managed through a JSON file.

It will generate permalinks based on the directory tree, but you can override it anytime by setting a `permalink` frontmatter.

## Instantly Deployable

Have an instance of Grundgesetz set up on GitHub? You can easily deploy it using the built-in `deploy` task. You can also set up a continuous deployment pipeline for hosting providers like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Blazing Fast

Grundgesetz is built on top of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), a blazing-fast static site generator for React. It takes your React components and Markdown files and builds an optimised static website which can be easily deployed on many static site hosts.
