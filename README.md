# grundgesetz-skeleton

> You have a documentation. I turn them into a website. Any questions?

Welcome to Grundgesetz. It's a skeleton for generating accessible documentation pages built on top of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org). It creates static pages from your Markdown documentation files, all prettily formatted with a easy-to-use layout.

Grundgesetz is initially built to solve internal issues in managing documentation for our products at [Kata.ai](https://kata.ai/), but at the same we also found out that it's a good base for quickly deploying a documentation site online, so we put this up for everyone to use.

### Just Your Docs

Grundgesetz is set up for you to get up and running straight away. All your docs are written in Markdown and go inside the `/docs` folder. The table of contents is managed through a JSON file.

It will generate permalinks based on the directory tree, but you can override it anytime by setting a `permalink` frontmatter.

### Instantly Deployable

Have an instance of Grundgesetz set up on GitHub? You can easily deploy it using the built-in `deploy` task. You can also set up a continuous deployment pipeline for hosting providers like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Blazing Fast

Grundgesetz is built on top of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), a blazing-fast static site generator for React. Grundgesetz is built on top of Gatsby, a blazing-fast static site generator for React. Want to learn more about Gatsby? [Click here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org).

Also, putting the words "blazing fast" into any project's README seems to attract a lot of folks lately.

## Geting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (8.0.0+)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (Optional. You can still use `npm` if you want, but this is for your own sanity.)

### Initializing the Project

Grundgesetz is built on top of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbjs.org). The best way to set it up is to install `gatsby-cli`. To install it, run the following command.

```bash
# npm
npm install -g gatsby-cli
# yarn
yarn global add gatsby-cli
```

Now we have `gatsby-cli` installed, we can now create a project based on the Grundgesetz skeleton by running:

```bash
gatsby new project-name https://github.com/kata-ai/grundgesetz-skeleton
```

Congratulations, you have now bootstrapped Grundgesetz!

The project is generated in your folder of choice (in this case `project-name`). In the next section, we will start writing our documentation on-the-fly with the development server.

### Running the server

Now that we have the project set up, let's `cd` to the generated project. Here we'll have to install our node dependencies. To do so, run the following command.

```bash
# npm
npm install
# yarn
yarn
```

To start working on our documentation, we need to start a development server.

```bash
# npm
npm dev
# yarn
yarn dev
```

The command above will start a development server with hot-reloading capabilities on `localhost:8000`. From now on, you can start writing your documentation with ease. In the next section, we will learn how to build your pages and deploy them.
