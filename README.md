# grundgesetz-skeleton

> You have a documentation. I turn it into a website. Any questions?

Welcome to Grundgesetz. It's a skeleton for generating accessible documentation pages built on top of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org). It creates static pages from your Markdown documentation files, all prettily formatted with a easy-to-use layout.

Grundgesetz is initially built to solve internal issues in managing documentation for our products at [Kata.ai](https://kata.ai/), but at the same we also found out that it's a good base for quickly deploying a documentation site online, so we put this up for everyone to use.

## What's with the name?

It's German for "constitution". We had a thing for German codenames here at Kata.ai.

## Who's using it?

- [Kata Platform Documentation](https://docs.kata.ai/)
- [TinaCMS](https://tinacms.org/docs/getting-started/introduction)
- [Accelero](https://docs.accelero.io/)

## Core Concepts

### Just Your Docs

Grundgesetz is set up for you to get up and running straight away. We know that writing proper documentation often takes a long time, so we aim to create this tool to standardise your documentation format.

All your docs are written in the familiar Markdown format and go inside the `/docs` folder. You can customise the table of contents and the header menu through a JSON file. It will generate pages with path names based on the directory tree, but you can override it anytime by setting a `permalink` frontmatter.

### Instantly Deployable

Since Grundgesetz is a static site generator, you can instantly deploy to any static web host.

Have an instance of Grundgesetz set up on GitHub? You can easily deploy it using the built-in `deploy` task. You can also set up a continuous deployment pipeline for hosting providers like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

### Blazing Fast

Grundgesetz is built on top of Gatsby, a blazing-fast static site generator for React. Also, putting the words "blazing fast" into any project's README seems to attract a lot of folks lately. So I put it in here. Sorry.

## Geting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (8.0.0+)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (Optional. You can still use `npm` if you want, but this is for your own sanity.)

### Initializing the Project

#### The Fast Way

You can now create a new repository with Grundgesetz included by going to the GitHub page clicking on the "Use this template" button on the top right.

![use-template](./static/img/use-template.png)

This will take you to the Create Repository screen. Fill in the details of your projects, and click "Create repository from template".

![new-repo-from-template](./static/img/new-repo-from-template.png)

Once the repository is created, you can [clone the repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) and open your terminal in the repository's folder. Once you're there, install the dependencies by running `yarn` (or `npm install`, if you prefer to use npm).

#### Using Gatsby CLI

Alternatively, you can bootstrap your project using `gatsby-cli`. To install it, run the following command.

```bash
# npm
npm install -g gatsby-cli
# yarn
yarn global add gatsby-cli
```

Now we have `gatsby-cli` installed, we can now create a project based on the Grundgesetz skeleton by running:

```bash
gatsby new project-name https://github.com/kata-ai/grundgesetz-skeleton
```

The project is generated in the folder with the `project-name` you specified. In the next section, we will start writing our documentation on-the-fly with the development server.

### Running the server

Now that we have the project set up, let's `cd` to the generated project. Here we'll have to install our node dependencies. To do so, run the following command.

```bash
# npm
npm install
# yarn
yarn
```

To start working on our documentation, we need to start a development server.

```bash
# npm
npm dev
# yarn
yarn dev
```

The command above will start a development server with hot-reloading capabilities on `localhost:8000`. From now on, you can start writing your documentation with ease.
